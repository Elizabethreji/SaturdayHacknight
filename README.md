# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME
.Rock Paper identification with TensorFlow and OpenCV
Overview
This repository contains the source code for a Rock, Paper identication implemented using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. The game uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of hand gestures to recognize and classify the player's moves in real-time.

Features
Real-time Gesture Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV to capture video frames from the webcam and TensorFlow to classify hand gestures as Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

Machine Learning Model: The core of the gesture classification is a pre-trained CNN built with TensorFlow and Keras, capable of accurate recognition.

User-friendly Interface: The game displays the live webcam feed with the recognized gesture overlaid, providing an interactive and engaging user experience.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy
